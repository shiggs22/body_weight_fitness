	<h2>Workout Instructions:</h2>
			<h3>To preform the pull up</h3>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Grab the pull-up bar with the palms facing forward using the 
					prescribed grip. Note on grips: For a wide grip, your hands need to be
					 spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium
					  grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your 
					  shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your 
					  shoulder width.</li>
					  
					<li>As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar 
					  at the chosen grip width, bring your torso back around 30 degrees 
					  or so while creating a curvature on your lower back and sticking 
					  your chest out. This is your starting position.</li>
					  
					<li>Pull your torso up until the bar touches your upper chest by 
					  drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. Exhale as 
					  you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Concentrate on 
					  squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted 
					  position. The upper torso should remain stationary as it moves 
					  through space and only the arms should move. The forearms should 
					  do no other work other than hold the bar.</li>
					  
					<li>After a second on the contracted position, start to inhale and 
					  slowly lower your torso back to the starting position when your 
					  arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.</li>
					  
					<li>Repeat this motion for the prescribed amount of repetitions.</li>
				</ol>
		
			<h3>To preform the dip</h3>
				
				<ol>
					<li>To get into the starting position, hold your body at arm's length 
				with your arms nearly locked above the bars.</li>
				
					<li>Now, inhale and slowly lower yourself downward. Your torso should 
				remain upright and your elbows should stay close to your body. This helps 
				to better focus on tricep involvement. Lower yourself until there is a 
				90 degree angle formed between the upper arm and forearm.</li>
				
					<li>Then, exhale and push your torso back up using your triceps to 
					bring your body back to the starting position.</li>
				
					<li>Repeat the movement for the prescribed amount of repetitions.</li>
				</ol>
			
			<h3>To preform the squats</h3>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. You can place your 
					hands behind your head. This will be your starting position.</li>
				
					<li>Begin the movement by flexing your knees and hips, sitting back 
					with your hips.</li>
				
					<li>Continue down to full depth if you are able,and quickly reverse 
					the motion until you return to the starting position. As you squat, 
					keep your head and chest up and push your knees out.</li>
				</ol>
			
			<h3>To preform the push up</h3>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Lie on the floor face down and place your hands about 36 inches 
					apart while holding your torso up at arms length.</li>
				
					<li>Next, lower yourself downward until your chest almost touches the 
				floor as you inhale.</li>
				
					<li>Now breathe out and press your upper body back up to the starting 
				position while squeezing your chest.</li>
				
					<li>After a brief pause at the top contracted position, you can begin 
					to lower yourself downward again for as many repetitions as 
					needed.</li>
				</ol>
			
			
			<section>
			<h3>Sets and Reps</h3>
				
				<p>While preforming this workout, you <strong>will</strong> do 10 sets of 
				10 reps. This is a superset workout but you WILL preform on after another. 
				You <strong>do not</strong> need to get 10 reps but try your best to do 
				so. Preform this workout 3 days a week or during your working rest day.</p>
